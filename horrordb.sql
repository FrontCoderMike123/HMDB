The voices "tell me to say I hate people", says Michael. His dreams were filled with images of actual events that took place several centuries ago at the dawn of the Celtic age.

He is portrayed by American actor Tobin Bell.\n\nIn the series'' narrative, Kramer is a former civil engineer dying from an inoperable frontal lobe tumor that had developed from colon cancer. After a failed suicide attempt, Kramer found a new appreciation for his life, and decided to dedicate the rest of his life to inspiring the same appreciation in others by testing their will to live. His methods include forcing his subjects through deadly scenarios, which he referred to as "games" or "tests", in which they were forced to inflict pain upon themselves or others in order to escape. These tests were typically symbolic of what Jigsaw perceived as a flaw in each person''s moral character or life. The Jigsaw name was given to him by the media for his practice of cutting a puzzle piece shape of flesh from those who fail.', 'First Victim', 'Jigsaw was introduced in the 2004 film Saw through the character Lawrence Gordon''s recounting of his first killings. Jigsaw is described as a mysterious person who kidnaps people he believes take their lives for granted and subjects them to "tests", usually mechanical devices rigged to maim or kill the subjects if they fail to complete it within a certain time period. Unlike most killers, Jigsaw never intends to kill his subjects; the purpose of his traps is to see if the subject has the will to live, as he hopes their experience will teach them the value of life. In John''s mind the deaths of those that fail is justified, because those who fail to do what''s necessary to survive don''t deserve life. As his victims increase, the media dubs him The Jigsaw Killer, or simply Jigsaw, because of the jigsaw puzzle-shaped piece of flesh that he removes from unsuccessful subjects, which he explains in Saw II is meant to symbolize that the subject "was missing a vital piece of the human puzzle: the survival instinct."', 'Height', '5''9"', 'Weight', 'Loses more each day', 'Weapon of Choice', 'Torture Mechanisms', 'Number of Victims', '82 victims', 'List of Films', 'Saw (2004)<br>\r\nSaw II (2005)<br>\r\nSaw III (2006)<br>\r\nSaw IV (2007)<br>\r\nSaw V (2008)<br>\r\nSaw VI (2009)<br>\r\nSaw 3D 2010\r\n', 'Killer Description', 'The producers of the Saw films have fought to differentiate the Jigsaw Killer from other horror film killers. Darren Lynn Bousman, the director of Saw II, Saw III, and Saw IV, has stated on the character''s role "He''s not Jason or Freddy. He''s not even Hannibal Lecter. He''s a person with extreme beliefs and he really thinks he''s making a difference. He''s a vigilante if anything. He thinks he''s making a difference." Tobin Bell, the actor who plays Jigsaw, describes his character''s role as being more of a scientist or engineer and "he thinks very specifically and very pragmatically". About Jigsaw''s games being detail oriented, Bell said: "My sense is that Jigsaw is so detail oriented that I think he thinks in terms of worst case scenario. I think he''s a very good judge of character, so his sense that, for example, that Detective Matthews was going to play right into his trap, which he did, was right on. Now, it seems to me that he''s always got a second plan in place. And there''s probably been a number of second plans. I mean, we''ve only seen three movies. Maybe there are six more somewhere where he failed, where something didn''t play out" Speaking about playing the character Bell stated that "you have to think of someone like Jigsaw from a very specific point of view. He doesn''t view himself as some kind of diabolical psychotic. You know there''s a little bit of evil in everyone. It just gets carried further. Most of us have some sort of moral fiber that restricts that. Some framework. And then others because of their lives and what happens to them, the thing develops in some other way."'),

The character''s appearance in 1987''s Hellraiser marked a significant departure from the standard 1980s depiction of horror movie villains, who tended to either be completely mute, or provide glib commentary while killing their victims.
